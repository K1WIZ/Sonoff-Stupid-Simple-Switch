#SONOFF WIFI SWITCH USING LOCAL SERVER

This is a custom & basic no frills firmware for Sonoff (and other ESP82XX based) switches.
This firmware allows you to remove the stock firmware and hence reliance on the 
manufacturer's cloud based control.  This may be desireable in air-gapped applications
where the switch wouldn't have access to the internet, or where maximum security is 
required.

For now, IP addresses are hardcoded, but the code can be modified to use DHCP where desired.

Enjoy!
